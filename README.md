# ZFS snapshot management script

This is a simple script for creating, pruning, and listing ZFS snapshots. See
`example.crontab` for a demonstration of how this can be used to configure
rolling snapshots with a simple retention policy.

This script is lightly tested, and more robust alternatives are available.
Use at your own risk.
